## Project Overview

In this project, you’ll be building a webpage using a provided design, and you’ll focus on getting the layout and styles close to the design mockups. The project is divided into a few steps:

1. **HTML Structure**: Set up the basic structure of the webpage using HTML.
2. **Styling**: Apply CSS to bring the design to life. This includes layout techniques like Flexbox, working with fonts and colors, and spacing elements effectively.
3. **Responsive Design**: (Optional for now) While this project doesn’t require full responsiveness, it’s good practice to understand how layout works on different screen sizes.

The webpage will have the following sections:
- **Hero Section**: The large, eye-catching area at the top with a statement or call to action.
- **Content Section**: Includes any information or items that are part of the main body of the page.
- **Footer**: A footer section that contains information like copyright, links, or other content.
